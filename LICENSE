RLX Rixmerz License (RXL) v1.1

Free Core Software License with Open Ecosystem Allowance

Copyright (c) 2026 Rixmerz
All rights reserved except as expressly granted by this license.

================================================================================

1. Definitions

"Core Software": the original software, its source code, core binaries, and
official components released under this license.

"Extension / Plugin / Add-on": any separate module, plugin, integration, theme,
service, or extension that interfaces with the Core Software but is not a
modification of it.

"Marketplace": any platform or mechanism used to distribute Extensions or Plugins.

"Derivative Work": a modification of the Core Software itself.

================================================================================

2. Grant of Rights (Core Software)

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, on a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive basis, to any Holder to:

  - Use the Core Software for any purpose
  - Study and modify the Core Software
  - Redistribute the Core Software only under this same license

================================================================================

3. Mandatory Gratuity of the Core

3.1 Core Software is always free

The Core Software must always remain completely free of charge, in all cases
and for all users.

No party may:

  - Sell the Core Software
  - Charge for access, usage, activation, or licensing of the Core Software
  - Restrict the Core Software behind paywalls or subscriptions

3.2 No indirect monetization of the Core

The Core Software may not be monetized directly or indirectly, including but
not limited to:

  - Paid distributions
  - Dual licensing of the Core
  - "Premium" Core versions
  - Mandatory paid services tied to Core access

================================================================================

4. Derivative Works (Strict Copyleft)

Any modification or Derivative Work of the Core Software:

  - Must be released under this same Rixmerz License (RXL)
  - Must remain completely free of charge
  - May not introduce monetization mechanisms

================================================================================

5. Extensions, Plugins and Marketplace Exception

5.1 Independent Extensions

Extensions, plugins, add-ons, or services that:

  - Are developed independently
  - Do not modify the Core Software code
  - Interface with the Core Software through public APIs or extension mechanisms

may be released under any license, including commercial licenses, and may be
sold or monetized.

5.2 Marketplace and Commissions

The author of the Core Software (Rixmerz) may operate or authorize a Marketplace
for Extensions and Plugins.

In such cases:

  - Paid Extensions are allowed
  - Marketplace fees or commissions are explicitly permitted
  - Revenue sharing models are allowed

This does not violate the gratuity of the Core Software.

================================================================================

6. Boundary Rule (Very Important)

If a component:

  - Modifies the Core Software
  - Is required for the Core Software to function
  - Replaces or restricts Core functionality

Then it is considered part of the Core Software and must be free under this
license.

================================================================================

7. Attribution

All distributions of the Core Software or Derivative Works must include:

  - The license name: Rixmerz License (RXL)
  - A full copy of this license
  - Credit to the original author: Rixmerz

================================================================================

8. No Warranty

THE CORE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER
IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE CORE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE CORE
SOFTWARE.

================================================================================

9. Termination

Any violation of the Core gratuity rules automatically terminates the rights
granted under this license.

================================================================================

10. Final Principle

The Core belongs to everyone.
The ecosystem may thrive freely around it.
What is essential stays free forever.

================================================================================
